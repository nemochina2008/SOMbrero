* other features (easy)
** add a function graph2SOM that projects a graph on the grid
   (use projectGraph), create a class and a plot method for it
** add weights to observations
** implement weighted graphs projection
** change palette defaults of pie plots (currently limited to 
   the 8 standard colors)
** add control for scaling of names plots in WUI

* other features (hard)
** grid.topology: hexagonal
** repeat SOM and combine
** multiple dissimilarities
** kacm
** batch version

* implementation enhancement
** should maybe improve the distance handling and propagate it everywhere
** colors handling in "names" seems to sometimes bugs
** make a function for initializing colors init.color(clustering, def.color)
** dissimilarity should maybe algorithm requires a "dist" type input
